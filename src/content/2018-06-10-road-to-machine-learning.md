  I do node.js, Angular1/2/3/4/5/6, Ionic1/2, MongoDB, Typescript, and so on. Also, because I work in a startup and we you don't have a lot of human resources, I learnt how to use Amazon Web Services, like EC2, Elasticbeanstalk, CodeDeploy, Cloudfront, and so on, I think devops, is what I love the most.

  <p>
  But, the problem is, that I don't want to do that anymore, I would like to work on AI projects,   
  that fancy ones that you read in the news, work with self-driving cars, autonomous robots, and etc, not just because is cool, but also because I want to contribute to the future of the humanity. And working hard and wast time just to make another web page / web product will only benifice me (and my employeer) through money

  Maybe I don't have a PhD in Computer Sciences, maybe I don't know advance multivariable calculu (yet)
  But what I know, is that you can LEARN a lot, really, if you like the subject, you 'll do it.
  When I started with web development 3-4 years ago, I didn't know what the duck was an endpoint, a REST design, or any fancy software design pattern, but I learnt. And god do I learnt, I read tons of documentation, medium post, books, watch videos, attended to conferences, asked for help, and never give up. I do not deploy a full microservices base solution on AWS the first day, I bearly code a Meteor app and hardly deploy to heroku after crying blood. So I know, it get's better, after some time.
  </p>
  <p>I know this is gonna be the most hard path that I ever chose, but I'm commited to make it</p>

  <p>Enough rant! </p>
