# How to scale node.js applications? ü§î

  Scaling servers never have to be with the technology behind, but with the problem, they are aimed to solve.

  Netflix uses node.js for its microservices infrastructure, but they have a video streaming platform that needs to serve a million concurrent connections.

  A node.js backend for a real-time chat application can handle a different load that an e-commerce app.
  Here are some considerations and common issues that many development teams face at the moment of scaling a node.js application.

  I worked for a couple of startups who started their software products just from a simple express.js template that we found on GitHub.

  At Whyline for example, back in 2015, I was who installed the ["Angular Full-Stack"](https://github.com/angular-fullstack/generator-angular-fullstack) template from Yeoman (Oh boy I'm old).

  The product grows fast, and in the process, we had to almost re-write the backend server, change the semi-monolithic architecture to a microservices, move the web-client to a CDN.

  And so many other things, performance improvements in Linux AMIs, refactors to several layers, typescript appears, re-write services, pub-sub, sockets, implement patterns, search solution, Redis, and so.

  _It will take me a whole year to write about all_

  Now, I work as a freelancer, and every new project that I arrived has this same scalability issues, so today I want to talk about how they are holding back your node.js server from growing and reaching a high scalability state.

# Serving static assets üì¶

  Why do you have your angular or react app served by express?

  **Node.js wasn't designed to serve static assets, it take so many cpu% time.**

  You should be using a proxy CDN like CloudFront infront of your static files.

  I believe the root of the problem comes from the amount of starter templates that comes with a "full-stack" solution for building an MVP.
  But when your product and user base grows, you will face a problem, your servers will use too many CPU time.

  ## Please DON'T USE gzip compression

  I know, [it's in the express.js documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html), it should be a good thing right? 

  Well, no, compressing a response involves CPU computation.
  So it's better to delegate that to the proxy, CloudFront has the option to set compression, as well as other proxies like Nginx.

  [Check this article on how to implement AWS S3 + AWS Cloudfront for doing this task.](/s3-cloudfront-angular-react)

  Also you can use Netlify which is [totally free for 100GB network](https://www.netlify.com/tos/) traffic monthly and 1TB traffic for paid accounts.

  As an example of how much is it, **this blog is hosted on Netlify** and each page weight almost 800kb, so I can have around **100.000 visits/month for free.**

  # A good task scheduler ‚è∞

  It's so common needing some kind of recurring task, maybe you need to fire a reminder for a user once a day, or calculating the billing of the service for a customer once a month.

  But you shouldn't rely on simple `setTimeout` or `setInterval` for doing such tasks.

  This will bring you troubles when you will try to scale horizontally your servers, the cron jobs will be duplicated and chaos can occur.

  Also, what happens every time your server reboot? you just recalculate the next time the cron should run? what happens if the task fails?

  How do you know what task is scheduled to run? How do you run it manually?

  It's a better approach to use a task scheduler framework like Agenda.js who has a separate module for an admin dashboard.

  ![nodejs clustering overview](/img/nodejs-scalability/clustering.png)

  Is 2019 and still most developers don't use the cluster feature that comes built-in in node since version 0.12.0

  By default it works like this: **the master process listens on a port**, accepts new connections and **distributes them across the workers in a round-robin fashion**, with some built-in smarts to avoid overloading a worker process.

  Check this comparasions:

  - Reponse time _lower is better_
  ![nodejs cluster performance graph](/img/nodejs-scalability/cluster_mode.png)

  - Concurrent connections _higher is better_
  ![nodejs cluster performance table](/img/nodejs-scalability/cluster_mode_2.png)

## Cluster mode implementation

  Implementation is pretty straight foward if you have your project correctly structured.

  Go to your project entry point, require cluster mode, and spawn your application when the process is a worker.
  
  ![Project structure](/img/nodejs-scalability/folder_structure.png)

  _I recommend you checking out my guide on a good project structure for node.js server._

  _File: app.js_
  ```javascript
  const express = require('express');

  module.exports = () => {
    const app = express();
    // Just a basic route
    app.get('/', function (req, res) {
      res.send('Hello World!');
    });
    app.listen(4000);
    console.log('Application running!');
  }
  ```
  We are setting up our server, notting new or fancy here.

  _File: index.js_
  ```javascript
  const cluster = require('cluster');
  const os = require('os');
  const runExpressServer = require('./app');

  // Check if current process is master.
  if (cluster.isMaster) {
    // Get total CPU cores.
    const cpuCount = os.cpus().length;

    // Spawn a worker for every core.
    for (let j = 0; j < cpuCount; j++) {
      cluster.fork();
    }
  } else {
    // This is not the master process, so we spawn the express server.
    runExpressServer();
  }

  // Cluster API has a variety of events.
  // Here we are creating a new process if a worker die.
  cluster.on('exit', function (worker) {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.id} died'`);
    console.log(`Staring a new one...`);
    cluster.fork();
  });

  ```

  First we are requiring `cluster` module. Then we check if the current process is master.
  If so, we get the total amount of cpu cores and spawn worker processes.
  Other wise, current code is a worker, so we initialize our app here.
  Also, we are setting up a subscriber for the event 'exit'. If a worker dies for any reason, we spawn a new one in replacement.

  It may seem scary to try this out in your already in production server, but you don't have to worry.
  Unless, you are using some type of home-made CRON in the same server that runs your API.

  [And we already talk about this, in the previous section.](/#jobs)

# Conclusion

  I guaranty you that you will be able to handle more traffic if you follow these considerations.

  Serving static assets with node.js is a task that demands a lot of CPU, node.js wasn't designed for that.

  Having your cron jobs inside Agenda will benefice you at the moment of doing horizontal scalability.

  And don't forget to enable the power of cluster mode from day 1 to make use of all the resources available in the machine.

  My experience has tough me that once you scale your node.js server, _maybe by throwing all away in move to AWS Lambda_, the next big challange is scaling the database behind.

  And that's something that we'll discuss in a future post.
