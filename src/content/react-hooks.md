  Starting of React `16.8.0` there are new ways to call async code in an elegant way, reuse logic between components much more easily.

  As a reactjs developer, is your duty to stay up to date with the new react framework features.
  Not to please your boss but to stay relevant in the field and the market.

  I still remember good old days when nobody was talking about the redux pattern and my reacts apps were a state mess (mid 2014).

  When the flux pattern was introduced at first it was hard to understand and seems very complicated to implement, but now a few years later is the standard in every react framework based project.

  With react hooks will happen the same, is the replacement for class components and the future of react framework.
  
  All right this is gonna be a **long post**, so I added a table of content so you can read a little, then continue working on your project, and come back later when you need a break.

  _I'm the only one who reads technical articles to clean my mind and release stress from my day-to-day work ?_

# What are React hooks anyway? ü§î

  When you work with Reactjs class components you can use state, that's why these components are also called stateful, also every class component has lifecycle methods like: `componentDidMount()`, `componentDidUpdate()`, and so on.

  You can't use any of this in functional components.
  Functional components can‚Äôt use their own state and don‚Äôt have lifecycle methods.

  **Now with React hooks you can.**

  React hooks allows us to take a Reactjs functional component and add state and lifecycle methods to it.

  In simple words, React hooks are **special functions** to extend the capabilities of functional components and give them the possibility to have **lifecycle events** and **manage state.**

<a name="classes-vs-hooks"></a>

  Let's compare how a class differs from a functional component when React hooks are used.

  ## The good old fashion class-based way

  ```javascript
  import React from 'react';
  class ClickCounter extends React.Component {

    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        count: 0 // Initial value for our counter
      };
    }

    setCount(numb) {
      this.setState({
        count: numb
      })
    }

    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
          <button onClick={() => this.setCount(this.state.count + 1).bind(this)}>
            Click me
          </button>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }
  ```
  ## With React hooks
  ```javascript
  import React, { useState } from 'react';
  function ClickCounter() {
    /** 
      useState creates a "count" variable that will store the state and a "setCount" function that will mute the "count" variable state.
    **/
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```
  _Example using `useState` hook to store state in a function component_

  **Fewer lines of code to do the same thing!**

  But is not just that, with React hooks **you can now reuse stateful logic** and have a **better separation of concerns**.

  At first, this new API may appear weird to you but stay with me, you will learn how to get the most out of it.

<a name="existing-hooks"> </a>

# The existing React hooks üç±

  The new API comes with two main pre-existing hooks, and some others for other use cases

### Basics React hooks

  The foundation of all React hooks, every other hook you will see is a variation of these three or are using them as primitives.

  - The `useState` is the _State hook_ use it for declaring the state in your components

  - The `useEffect` is the _Side effects hook_ use it for data fetching, manually changing the DOM, and etc.

  - The `useContext` use it in conjunction with Reactjs Context API. When the React Context provider updates, this hook will trigger render with the latest context value.

### Advance React hooks

  These are the most important of the other built-in React hooks that come with the library.

  - The `useReducer` is an alternative to `useState`, you should use it when you have complex state logic, if you‚Äôre familiar with Redux you will like it.

  - The `useRef` use it for accessing a DOM element with a mutable ref object. Is more useful than the `ref` attribute


<a name="notation"></a>

## Those peculiar brackets

  You might be asking what the syntax `const [age, setAge] = useState(24)` means, 
  but is just the new way to destructuring an array, let me show you another way to do it.

  ```javascript
  const ageStateVariable = useState(24); // Returns a tuple or an array of length 2
  const age = ageStateVariable[0]; // First item
  const setAge = ageStateVariable[1]; // Second item

  // ES6 way to do this
  const [age, setAge] = useState(24);
  ```

  **I love simple and elegant one-liners**, _not as much as python people, and definitively I do NOT like insane one-liners as python people_ 

### Rules

 - Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function

 - Never call a Hook from a regular function

 - Only call them inside functions components or custom hooks

 - Hooks should sit at the top level of your component

 - Hooks can call other Hooks

<a name="use-state"> </a>

# The `useState` hook üé≤

  The easiest to use and understand all the hooks. Its purpose is to store the state in a functional component.

  > Well, technically we are not storing state inside it, but hooking into the dictionary (key-value) of states that are handled by the react library under the hood. _But we are not going to deep into that details for now_

  ```javascript
  import React, { useState } from 'react';

  function myAwesomeComponent () {
    const [name, setName] = useState('John');
    ...
  }
  ```

  The useState returns a tuple with a _state holder_  property and a setter method.

  You invoke useState with the initial value for your state.

  To update the state you call the `setName` function

<a name="use-effect"> </a>

# The `useEffect` hook üçØ

  In a React class, you would typically set up a subscription in `componentDidMount`, and clean it up in `componentWillUnmount`.

  With react hook `useEffect` we perform this by returning a function to clean up or _unsubscribe_ the effect.

  If you have worked with `mobx` this pattern may result familiar to you, it's an analogy to a reaction.

```javascript
  useEffect(() => {
    PlacesAPI.subscribeToPlaceNews(props.place.id, handlePlacesNews);
    return () => {
      PlacesAPI.unsubscribeFromPlaceNews(props.place.id, handlePlacesNews);
    };
  });
```

  ### Why did we return a function from our effect? 

  This is the optional cleanup mechanism for effects. Every effect may return a function that cleans up after it.

  This lets us keep the logic for adding and removing subscriptions close to each other. 

<a name="use-reducer"> </a>

# The `useReducer` hook üé£
  When you have complex state logic, it's a good idea to use a `reducer`. If you are familiar with libraries like `Redux` or the `flux pattern` you will understand this at first glance.

  ![Redux pattern architecture](/img/react-hooks/redux-pattern.png)

  Basically with a reducer you `dispatch` or trigger some actions in your view, those events are listened by a reducer who has the logic inside to update the store which is where your state lives. Now when the store is updated, your component will rerender.


```javascript

import React, { useReducer, useState } from 'react';
import produce from 'immer';

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'toggle':
      return produce(state, (draftState) => {
        draftState[action.payload].isCompleted = !draftState[action.payload].isCompleted;
      });
    case 'add':
      return produce(state, (draftState) => {
        draftState.push({ label: action.payload });
      });
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function Todo({ isCompleted, label, onChange }) {
  return <p>
    <label style={{
      textDecoration: isCompleted && 'line-through'
    }}>
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        checked={isCompleted || false}
        onChange={onChange}
      />
      <span>{label}</span>
    </label>
  </p>
}

function TodoList() {
  const todos = [
    { label: 'Do something' },
    { label: 'Buy dinner' }
  ];

  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, todos);
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');

  return <>
    {state.map((todo, i) => (
      <Todo
        key={i}
        {...todo}
        onChange={() => dispatch({ type: 'toggle', payload: i })}
      />
    ))}
    <input
      type="text"
      value={newTodo}
      onChange={(e) => setNewTodo(e.target.value)}
    />
    <button onClick={() => {
      dispatch({ type: 'add', payload: newTodo });
      setNewTodo('');
    }}>
      Add
    </button>
  </>;
}

export default TodoList;
```

<a name="use-ref"> </a>

# The `useRef` hook üîÆ
  **Refs** are used to access React elements or DOM elements rendered in the **render** function.
  The hook `useRef` returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument `initialValue`.
  It's very simple to use

  ```javascript
  function TextInputWithFocusButton() {
    const inputEl = useRef(null);
    const onButtonClick = () => {
      // `current` points to the mounted text input element
      inputEl.current.focus();
    };
    return (
      <>
        <input ref={inputEl} type="text" />
        <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Focus the input</button>
      </>
    );
  }
  ```

<a name="separation-concerns"> </a>

# Separation of concerns üéé

![Mantain your code organized](/img/react-hooks/organized.jpeg)

  With Hooks, you can **extract stateful logic** from a component so it **can be tested independently and reused**. 

  Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy.

  Example, components might perform some data fetching in `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`. 

  However, the same `componentDidMount` method **might also contain unrelated logic** that sets up event listeners, with cleanup performed in `componentWillUnmount`. 

  Mutually related code that changes together gets split apart, but **completely unrelated code ends up combined in a single method.**

```javascript
  import React from 'react';
  import PlacesAPI from '../services/place';
  class PlaceNewsWithCounter extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.handlePlacesNews = this.handlePlacesNews.bind(this);
      this.state = { count: 0, currentEvent: null };
    }

    // Unrelated stateful logic
    componentDidMount() {
      document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
      PlacesAPI.subscribeToPlaceNews(
        this.props.place.id,
        this.handlePlacesNews
      );
    }

    componentDidUpdate() {
      document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
    }

    componentWillUnmount() {
      PlacesAPI.unsubscribeFromPlaceNews(
        this.props.place.id,
        this.handlePlacesNews
      );
    }

    handlePlacesNews(place) {
      this.setState({
        currentEvent: place.currentEvent
      });
    }
    ...
  }
```

  ### A better approach using React hooks

```javascript
  import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
  import PlacesAPI from '../services/place';
  function PlaceNewsWithCounter() {

    // Logic for counter here...
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    useEffect(() => {
      document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
    });


    // Logic for place API here...
    const [currentEvent, setCurrentEvent] = useState(null);

    function handlePlacesNews(place) {
      setCurrentEvent(place.currentEvent);
    }

    useEffect(() => {
      PlacesAPI.subscribeToPlaceNews(props.place.id, handlePlacesNews);

      return () => {
        PlacesAPI.unsubscribeFromPlaceNews(props.place.id, handlePlacesNews);
      };
    });


    return ...;
  }
```

# Advance use cases ü§µ

  ![Like a boss](/img/react-hooks/professional.jpg)

  ## Using `useEffect` for data fetching

  With the combination of `useEffect` and `useState`, you can make API calls by using `useEffect` and passing in an empty array or object as the second argument to have the same behavior as **componentDidMount**

  The key here is the second argument. If you don't provide an empty array or object as the second argument, the API call will be called on every render, and it effectively becomes the same as a **componentDidUpdate**

  ```javascript
    const [todo, setTodo] = useState(null);
    const [id, setId] = useState(1);
    
    useEffect(() => {
      if (!id) {
        return;
      }
      
      fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/${id}`)
        .then(results => results.json())
        .then(data => {
          setTodo(data);
        });
    }, [id]);  // Don't forget to add this!
  ```
  By passing a second parameter to useEffect we are setting a _subscription_ whenever the _id_ property change the effect will be retriggered

  If instead, we would like to make an API call **ONLY** when the component is mounted

  ```javascript
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://randomuser.me/api/')
      .then(results => results.json())
      .then(data => {
        const {name} = data.results[0];
        setFullName(`${name.first} ${name.last}`);
      });
  }, []); // <-- Have to pass in [] here!
  ```

  <a name="online-status"></a>

  ## Show online status 
  Detect the user's device online status.
  _[(credits to mathdroid)](https://github.com/rehooks/online-status)_

  ### Hook implementation 

  ```javascript
  import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

  function getOnlineStatus() {
    return typeof navigator !== "undefined" &&
      typeof navigator.onLine === "boolean"
      ? navigator.onLine
      : true;
  }

  export const useOnlineStatus = () => {
    let [onlineStatus, setOnlineStatus] = useState(getOnlineStatus());
    const goOnline = () => setOnlineStatus(true);
    const goOffline = () => setOnlineStatus(false);

    useEffect(() => {
      window.addEventListener("online", goOnline);
      window.addEventListener("offline", goOffline);
      return () => {
        window.removeEventListener("online", goOnline);
        window.removeEventListener("offline", goOffline);
      };
    }, []);

    return onlineStatus;
  }
  ```

  ### Hook Usage

  ```javascript
  const App = () => {
    let onlineStatus = useOnlineStatus();
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>You are {onlineStatus ? "Online" : "Offline"}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  <a name="geo-location"></a>

  ## Detect geolocation changes
  Tracks geolocation state of user's device.

  ### Hook implementation 
  ```javascript
  import {useState, useEffect} from 'react';
  const useGeolocation = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState({
    loading: true,
    accuracy: null,
    altitude: null,
    altitudeAccuracy: null,
    heading: null,
    latitude: null,
    longitude: null,
    speed: null,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  });
  let mounted = true;
  let watchId: any;

  const onEvent = (event: any) => {
    if (mounted) {
      setState({
        loading: false,
        accuracy: event.coords.accuracy,
        altitude: event.coords.altitude,
        altitudeAccuracy: event.coords.altitudeAccuracy,
        heading: event.coords.heading,
        latitude: event.coords.latitude,
        longitude: event.coords.longitude,
        speed: event.coords.speed,
        timestamp: event.timestamp,
      });
    }
  };
  const onEventError = (error: any) =>
    mounted && setState(oldState => ({...oldState, loading: false, error}));

  useEffect(() => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(onEvent, onEventError);
    watchId = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(onEvent, onEventError);

    return () => {
      mounted = false;
      navigator.geolocation.clearWatch(watchId);
    };
  }, [0]);

  return state;
};
  ``` 
  ### Hook Usage

  ```javascript
  const Demo = () => {
    const state = useGeolocation();

    return (
      <pre>
        {JSON.stringify(state, null, 2)}
      </pre>
    );
  };
  ```

# Conclusion  üéâ

  The new React hooks API is a game changer, now we can use state in function components, 
reuse stateful logic.

  We learn about `useState` and `useEffect`, those are the primitives for every hook you will see.

  **Remember, every new hook is a derivation of one of those two.**

  We talk about others react built-in hooks such as `useReducer` and `useRef`.

  We create our own custom hooks to handle data fetching and we implement our own version of `useReducer` to demonstrate the magic behind it.

  **Keep it cool and continue learning!**
