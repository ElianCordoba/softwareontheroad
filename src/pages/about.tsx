              And just me, no unknown developers in the shadows.

            <h2> Work metodology  </h2>
            <div>
              I'm based in Europe, timezone CET, and work from 9:30 to 17:30, local time.
              <br />
              I only accept remote jobs, but if you happen to be nearby we can arrange a personal meeting.
              <br />
              I use <a href="https://toggl.com/"> Toggl </a> to keep track of the time I work so I wouldn't charge you more.

              <br/>

              <br />

              <br />
              I do have a registered software company (LLC) with a proper tax number, and I will generate you an invoice for my services.
              <br />

              We both sign a contract of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement"> non disclosure agreement (NDA) </a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_of_work"> statment of work (SOW)</a>.
