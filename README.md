# My roadmap to learning Machine Learning
  

# Motivation

   I'm a kinda fullstack developer + devops + _whatever_title_you_gave_me_just_to_not_hire_anyone_more_, I do node.js, angular1/2/3/4/5/6, ionic1/2, MongoDB, Typescript, and so on. Also, because I work in a startup and we you don't have a lot of human resources, I learnt how to use Amazon Web Services, like EC2, Elasticbeanstalk, CodeDeploy, Cloudfront, and so on, I think devops, is what I love the most

  But, the problem is, that I don't want to do that anymore, I would like to work on AI projects, that fancy ones that you read in the news, work with self-driving cars, autonomous robots, and etc, not just because is cool, but also because I want to contribute to the future of the humanity. And working hard and wast time just to make another web page / web product will only benifice me (and my employeer) through money

  Maybe I don't have a PhD in Computer Sciences, maybe I don't know advance multivariable calculus (yet)
  But what I know, is that you can LEARN a lot, really, if you like the subject, you 'll do it.
  When I started with web development 3-4 years ago, I didn't know what the duck was an endpoint, a REST design, or any fancy software design pattern, but I learnt. And god do I learnt, I read tons of documentation, medium post, books, watch videos, attended to conferences, asked for help, and never give up. I do not deploy a full microservices base solution on AWS the first day, I bearly code a Meteor app and hardly deploy to heroku after crying blood. So I know, it get's better, after some time.

  I know this is gonna be the most hard path that I ever chose, but I'm commited to make it

  Enough rant! Let's WORK HARD

# The plan

  Do projects until face a wall, rollback a few steps, research a little more and try again
 

# Projects

I'm going to make every little project public

 ## My first neural network 

 [LINK](https://github.com/santiq/simple-nn)

 In this project I develop a library that do matrix operations (dot product, sum, multiplation, etc)
Then, I write a simple neural network, feedfoward, with only 1 hidden layer. 
I learnt about the maths beahind backpropagation, what is an activation function, why the matrix bias is added, and so on.

```javascript
 INPUTS * WEIGHTS + BIAS
```

 I trained a model that can solve XOR

 ## Linear Regression
  _It's just a fancy name for a model that can do binary classification_

  [LINK](https://github.com/santiq/linear-regression-tensor-flow)

  This one is a lot simple than the previous project, but I learnt about the Tensorflow.js API and some Keras (python framework)
  Using Tensorflow.js, _and some library that helpedme with the canvas_ I train a model that do linear regression.

  ```javascript
  X * M + B // IT'S THE SAME FORMULA AS A FEEDFOWARD NEURAL NETWORK!!! 
  ```
  
 ## Polinomial Regression

  **Working Progress**

 ## Train a model that recognize images

  **Coming soon**

 ## Using Q Learning, train a model to play a game like Chrome's endless runner

  **Comming soon**

 ## Deploy a tensorflow based api that do sentiment analysis
 
  **Comming soon**

 ## A simple model that predict stock prices based on previous prices

  **Comming Soon**
